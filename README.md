# Terma, art form system
Terma is an experimental term processing system for art forms  in Dutch.
The initial goal is to process and restructure the terms from Dutch AAT.
The Dutch AAT dataset is processed beforehand and saved in a MySQL database.

The approach of Terma is a Finite state machine with several transitions to validate, analyse and enrich the art forms.
The processed terms will be used for several functionalities on the online art network KSART.nl.
All the credits of the initial dataset goes to Dutch AAT.

See the FSM graph and the Wiki process page for more information about Terma.
